### Git and Github

- `Version` -> a particular state of a software.
- `Version control System` -> It is a tool to manage version and changes in a software.
  Version control System help us
  - to track changes
  - manage versions
  - compare changes in version
  - collaboration
- `example` of version control system is git.

- `Features of git` ->
  - open source
  - Flexibility
  - Easily maintains code integrity
  - secure

### Important Commands

- `git init` -> initialize the git repository
- `ls -a` -> These will show us hidden files
- `touch <filename>` -> Create a new file
- `vim <filename>` -> it is a terminal based code editor
- `git status` -> display the state of the working and staging area. It lets you see which change have been staged and which files aren't being tracked by git.
- `git add <filename>` -> select file and move it to staging area.
- `git commit -m "<message>"` -> commit a snapshot of all changes in the working directories.
- `git log` -> review and read a history of everything that happen to a repository.
- `git add .` -> it add all the changes.
- `git remote add origin <repo link>` ->
- `git push origin master` -> git push command is used to upload local repository to a remote repo.

### Some other stuffs

- `README.md` -> These file tells about our project and there is a breif description about our project.

- `Repository` -> It is a folder manage by git where we can track all the changes we are making in the project.

- `New version` is created or mentioned as a new commit. If we have to create a new version, we have to create a new commit.

- `vim` ->
  - press `i` to made some changes
  - press `esc + : + w + q` hit enter to save and exit

### Important points

- we don't have to initialise git again and again. Initialisation done only one time in a project.

- in these link `git remote add origin https://....git/` we are shifting our link to origin. we don't have to type that big link again and again in our terminal.
